Simple application that retrieves gif's from giphy API. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can click on buttons located under the header and application will make and AJAX call to the giphy API and retrieve a gif related to the button the user clicked. Users can also create a button with a different category using the input box and the application will dynamically create that button that will also execute the AJAX call. 


I made this little application because I live on Twitter. Reaction gifs are my favorites and especially ones that involve The Real Housewives or contestants from RuPaul's drag race. This one was the first app I got to make that dabbled in calls. It set the foundation for my backend skillset. Go ahead and keep hitting those buttons! Get all the gifs you want of your favorite "shady lady"!!!
